# Step 6: Testing Shorebird Updates

## 🧪 How to Test Updates (Like Testing Magic Tricks)

### Test 1: Check if Shorebird is Working
```bash
# Run your app in debug mode
flutter run

# In the terminal, you should see:
# "✅ Shorebird initialized successfully"
# OR
# "❌ Shorebird not available (debug mode)"
```

### Test 2: Make a Simple Change
1. Open `lib/views/splash_screen.dart`
2. Change the app subtitle from "Organize your thoughts beautifully" to "Your notes, magically updated!"
3. Save the file

### Test 3: Push the Update
```bash
# Build and push the update
shorebird patch android

# You should see:
# "✅ Patch created successfully"
# "🚀 Patch uploaded to Shorebird"
```

### Test 4: Test on Real Device
```bash
# Install the release version first
shorebird release android --dry-run

# Then install on device and check for updates
```

## 🕵️ Debugging Tips (When Magic Doesn't Work)

### If Shorebird Says "Not Available":
```bash
# Check if you're logged in
shorebird login

# Check your project setup
shorebird doctor

# Check if you have the right permissions
cat shorebird.yaml
```

### If Updates Don't Show:
1. Make sure you're using the **release** build, not debug
2. Check your internet connection
3. Wait 1-2 minutes for update to propagate
4. Kill and restart the app

### If Build Fails:
```bash
# Clean everything and try again
flutter clean
flutter pub get
shorebird release android
```
