# Step 5: Building Your App with Shorebird

## 🏗️ First Time Build (Like Building the Original LEGO House)

When you build your app for the FIRST TIME, you need to tell Shorebird "This is my base version":

```bash
# Navigate to your app folder
cd /Users/csgpakistana/FreelanceProjects/Advance-Note-App

# Build the release version with Shorebird
shorebird release android

# This will:
# 1. Build your app (takes 2-3 minutes)
# 2. Upload it to Shorebird servers
# 3. Give you an APK file to upload to Google Play Store
```

## 📱 What This Does:
- Creates a **release build** (the one you upload to Google Play)
- Registers this version with Shorebird as the "base version"
- Creates an APK file in `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/`

## 🎯 Next Steps After First Build:
1. Upload the APK to Google Play Store
2. Wait for approval (1-3 days)
3. Once live, you can start pushing updates!

## 🚀 Pushing Updates (The Magic Part!)

After your app is live on Google Play, you can push code updates instantly:

```bash
# Make changes to your Dart code (like changing colors, text, etc.)
# Then run:
shorebird patch android

# This will:
# 1. Build only the changed code (super fast!)
# 2. Upload the patch to Shorebird
# 3. Users get the update automatically!
```

## ✅ What You Can Update:
- Text and UI changes
- Colors and themes
- Button actions
- Database logic
- Ad placement
- Bug fixes

## ❌ What You CAN'T Update:
- Native Android code
- New permissions
- App icons
- App name
