# Step 3: Initialize Shorebird in Your Notes App

# 1. Navigate to your app folder in terminal
cd /Users/csgpakistana/FreelanceProjects/Advance-Note-App

# 2. Initialize Shorebird (this adds magic powers to your app!)
shorebird init

# This will:
# - Create a shorebird.yaml file (the magic config)
# - Ask you to choose your project from the list
# - Set up everything automatically

# 3. You'll see a file called "shorebird.yaml" created
# This file tells Shorebird about your app
